This project is designed to help you build a "Media Player App" that can handle thousands of requests per second using [ScyllaDB](https://github.com/scylladb/scylladb) and [ScyllaDB Cloud](https://www.scylladb.com/product/scylla-cloud/).

## Quick start

You can find language-specific implementations in their corresponding folder:

- [Python](/docs/source/build-with-python.md)
- [Rust](/docs/source/build-with-rust.md)
- [Ruby](/docs/source/build-with-ruby.md)
- [Elixir](/docs/source/build-with-elixir.md)
- [Csharp](/docs/source/build-with-csharp.md)


## Sample Projects

## Contributing

### Adding a Sample

If you want to add a project following the criteria in a new language, you're welcome to contribute! We're always looking for new contributors to all projects related to ScyllaDB Education center. 

Open an [issue](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-cloud-getting-started/issues/new) with the following information:

- Programming language
- Link to the Driver

and let's make it happen together!

### Reporting bugs

It is inevitable that code will have bugs. There are a few things you can do to
help the maintainer to fix the bug that you've discovered quicker:

* Include the version of the Driver;
* Include the Driver dependency versions that might be an error;
* Include a complete stack trace of the failure as well as any available logs;
* Include any additional information you think is relevant;

### Pull requests

If you're able to fix a bug yourself, you can [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) with the fix.
